Original files:
JexlArithmetic.java.
JexmArithmetic_1_10.java as an example.


Go to class diff calculator and print each statement that is being removed.
JexlArithmetic_1_10_removed.java. NRemoved = {set of all statements that removed}.


What are next steps?

Compliment:
JexlArithmeticTest_1_10_complement.java file.
Then you take JexlArithmetic.java file.
Then run the coverage tool that will add unique id in front of every line.

Then run JexlARithmeticTest_1_10_complement.java file on the modified JexlArithmetic.java file.
It will print UUID of all the statements that are executed. NExecuted = {set of all the statements that are executed by complement test file}

first qustion: NRemoved is subset of NExcuted. 100% success. If not figure out success percentage.

For example NRemoved has 5 statements. Nexecuted has 20 statements.  out of 5 statements only 4 are present in this 20 statements. Then success rate 80%.
